This repository is for translations of [Myrlyn](https://github.com/shundhammer/myrlyn). For more information, you can also look into this [issue](https://github.com/shundhammer/myrlyn/issues/45).
## How you can help to translate it
At the moment, the Weblate of codeberg.org is used. You can find it here: https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/myrlyn-lang/ 
If you want to add a language clone this repository and run this command with the desired locale instead of "nl" in the folder "po":
```
msginit --input=myrlyn.pot --locale=nl --output-file=nl.po
```
Then open a pull request and after some time you should be able to translate using Weblate.
