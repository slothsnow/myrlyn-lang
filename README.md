## Add a language
If you want to add a language clone this repository and run this command with the desired locale instead of "nl" in the folder "po":
```
msginit --input=myrlyn.pot --locale=nl --output-file=nl.po
```
Then download the locale from https://github.com/yast/yast-translations/tree/master/po/qt-pkg and run this (edited) command:
```
msgmerge nl.po ~/Downloads/nl.po -o nl.po
```
Then open a pull request and after some time you should be able to translate using Weblate.
